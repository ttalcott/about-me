				<p> My name is Travis Talcott and I was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico on April 10th, 1996! I have a few hobbies that I really enjoy doing. They are: playing guitar, writing songs, fly fishing, hiking with my dog, golfing, and working as a sound engineer.

					I like to stay busy and I am always searching for something new to accomplish. Last year it was running a marathon in Portland. This year I will be attempting to hike the Grand Canyon rim-to-rim in a day! I will not be going alone though. My girlfriend Madison, my mom, my sister Roushon, her boyfriend, and my second parents (my two next-door neighbors I grew up with) will be conquering this feat with me. It will not be easy but it will surely be an adventure!

					A long standing joke people always like to make about me is how I am a zookeeper which is a reference to how many animals my girlfriend and I take care of. In reality it is very ironic because Madison's father is the director of the Biopark here in Albuquerque... Plus I really don't think 3 cats, 3 fish, 1 dog and a ball python is enough to warrant the title of being a zookeeper.
